Develop a simple software to manage an event calendar,
Your team will develop a simple software to manage an event calendar, which is used to schedule the events held at different campus locations listed below.

HLL114, Hill Center, Busch

ARC103, Allison Road Classroom, Busch

BE_AUD, Beck Hall, Livingston

TIL232, Tillett Hall, Livingston

AB2225, Academic Building, College Avenue

MU302, Murray Hall, College Avenue

The software shall allow the users to book a room for an event or cancel an event on the calendar. The software shall be able to display the event calendar sorted by event date/time, by campus/building/room, or by the hosting department. Let’s assume the event calendar only opens to five departments: CS (computer science), EE (electrical engineering), ITI (information technology and informatics), MATH (mathematics) and BAIT (business analytics and information technology).

The software is an interactive system where the users enter command lines on the console/terminal, and the system immediately generates responses and output the results on the console/terminal. That is, when the user hits the enter key, the system reads the data entered, process the data, and immediately output the results.

A command line always begins with a command and followed by additional data tokens delimited by one or more spaces. Commands are in uppercase letter(s) and case-sensitive, which means the commands in lowercase letters are invalid. Below is a list of commands you must implement.

A command; to add an event to the event calendar. To book a timeslot on the calendar, an event shall include the event date, timeslot, location, contact and the duration of the event. Below is an example of a command line for

You are required to generate the Javadoc after you properly comment your code. Set the scope to ‘private” so your Javadoc will include the documentations for the private data members, constructors, private and public methods of all Java classes.

Generate the Javadoc in a single folder and include it in the zip file to be submitted to Canvas. You are responsible to double check your Javadoc folder after you generated it. Submitting an empty folder will result in 0 points. Open the folder and look for the index.html file. Double click the file and check every links to ensure all comments are NOT EMPTY. You will lose points if any description in the Javadoc is empty. You will lose 5 points for not including the Javadoc.
